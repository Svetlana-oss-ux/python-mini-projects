This code demonstrates Australian Income Tax Calculator
A simple Python project that calculates personal income tax based on Australia's progressive tax system for the 2020–21 financial year.

This was created as part of a university learning activity to practice control flow and user input handling in Python. The condition was to not use loops, functions, or methods.

Tax Brackets Used:
Taxable Income ($AUD)	Tax Rate / Calculation
$0 – $18,200	Tax = $0
$18,201 – $45,000	19¢ for every $1 over $18,200
$45,001 – $120,000	$5,092 + 32.5¢ for every $1 over $45,000
$120,001 – $180,000	$29,467 + 37¢ for every $1 over $120,000
$180,001 and above	$51,667 + 45¢ for every $1 over $180,000
